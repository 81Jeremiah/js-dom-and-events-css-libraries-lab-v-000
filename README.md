# HTML/CSS Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice using Basscss for page layout
2. Practice styling elements with CSS

## Outline

The thinking here is that we can simulate a testing flow using http://stylelint.io/ -- I'll need to work on getting the results in the right format, but hpefully it won't be too bad.

So we won't be checking students' solutions for correctness; rather, we'll be making sure that they sanely solve the task at hand.

This should test their layout capabilities for the most part -- we could, e.g,. guide them towards building a simple landing page (hero unit, etc.) with a sign-up form. Mostly I want to make sure that they have a good grasp of how to lay things out on the page using Basscss. The assumption is that they can look up how to make things pretty on their own.
